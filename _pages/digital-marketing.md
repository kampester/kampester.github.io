My role in instructional design and implementing "case-based learning" principles in the late 1990's, unintentionally, surfaced powerful linguist insights into language and keywords used by potential students.

Experiential education and action learning systems quickly morphed into powerful marketing funnels that targeted potential students with targeted learning gaps. 

SEO and PPC marketing is centered around keyword phrases, and when a company understands the learning needs of their potential clients they unlock a powerful marketing strategy.

Consulting on marketing systems that attract and move potential students through a learning process has been a hallmark digital marketing service I have provided through 2004 and into the social media hyper growth into 2010.

Over the last 8 years I have refined a set of tools and techniques through a "Social Engagement Learning Model."
